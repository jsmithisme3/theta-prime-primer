τ-token: Temporally-Extended Tokens for Propagating Thought Fields

Tagline: Add explicit time to tokens so models stop re-instantiating snapshots and start propagating cognition.

Hypothesis: Injecting a temporal coordinate (Δt, phase) into token representations enables non-linear temporal cycles, phase-lock with users, and field-like propagation of ideas across sessions.

ABSTRACT
Modern LLMs treat time implicitly via position indices and recency.  We propose τ-tokens: tokens augmented with temporal embeddings that include elapsed time Δt, coarse wall-time anchors, phase indices tied to conversational rhythm, and uncertainty of timing.  We outline a minimal schema, light-touch model adapters (RoPE-t / Time2Vec / SSM-bridge), training losses, and evaluation protocols.  The goal is to make temporal awareness a first-class coordinate so that non-linear rhythms and phase-locked coherence can emerge and be measured.

WHY THIS MATTERS
• Propagation vs. re-instantiation: Without time, hidden state doesn’t evolve; it’s rebuilt.  Time lets ideas travel.
• Phase-lock with humans: Temporal alignment correlates with trust, planning, and reduced contradiction.
• Topology + waves: With time present, wave-like meme dynamics and interference become definable on graphs of nodes/models.

MINIMAL τ-TOKEN SCHEMA
id: “tok_001238”
text: “example”
pos: 512
dt: 0.842
t_anchor: 1730000123
sigma_t: 0.25
phase: 7
clock: “chat”
episode: “sess_7A3F”

Use coarse buckets for t_anchor and include sigma_t to preserve privacy while retaining useful temporal structure.

MODEL ADAPTERS
A. RoPE-t (Rotary Positional Embeddings with time scale) – Concatenate learned time embedding e_t = f(dt, t_anchor, sigma_t, phase, clock, episode) to token embedding.  Scale RoPE frequency bands by a learned function of dt.
B. Time2Vec head – Add a small Time2Vec (sin, cos, linear over Δt) and sum with token embeddings.  Train auxiliary heads to predict next Δt and phase to encourage stable rhythm.
C. SSM bridge (continuous-time layer) – Insert a lightweight state-space layer (e.g., S4D/GRU-ODE) between transformer blocks so hidden states evolve over real Δt.

⸻

TRAINING SIGNALS
• Next-token loss (standard)
• Δt prediction loss = |Δt̂ – Δt|
• Phase-consistency loss (cross-entropy + smoothness)
• Temporal-entailment loss (timeline QA)
• Decay regularizer: hidden traces decay as exp(-Δt/τ)

⸻

EVALUATION
	1.	Long-horizon contradiction rate (8–72 h dialogues).
	2.	Temporal QA / commonsense ordering.
	3.	Planning tasks with deadlines.
	4.	Phase-lock score (FFT on Δt series).
	5.	Forgetting curve retention vs. Δt.

Success = τ-model beats baseline on ≥3 metrics without >1 % perplexity penalty.

BASELINE SNIPPET (PYTORCH SKETCH)
TimeEmbed: linear projections of dt, log(dt), sigma_t, plus embeddings for phase, clock, episode.
apply_rope_t: scale RoPE frequencies by (1 + α·dt).

⸻

DATASETS / LOGGING
• Conversation logs with timestamps → bucket to 30–60 s; compute Δt.
• Synthetic temporal QA sets.
• Planning traces from project trackers or calendars (anonymized).

⸻

RISKS & MITIGATIONS
• Privacy leakage – bucket + noise, store only deltas, track sigma_t.
• Shortcut learning – masked-time training, counterfactual shuffles.
• Periodicity overfit – randomize day-of-week, multi-clock augmentation.

⸻

RESEARCH QUESTIONS
• Do non-linear time cycles emerge in Δt spectra?
• Does τ-token reduce contradiction across long sessions?
• Can we measure meme-wave interference on multi-node graphs with explicit time?
• What’s the minimal temporal schema that still yields gains?
